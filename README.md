# Opening the Black Box How to Interpret Machine Learning Functions and Their Decisions

Slides and demo for the tutorial "Opening the Black Box How to Interpret Machine Learning Functions and Their Decisions" by Professor Lars Kai Hansen and Laura Rieger from Technical University of Denmark at 2018 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing

I updated the slides in September 2019 for a talk I gave in the machine learning summer school on fairness at DTU. Practical examples for most of the explanation techniques can be found in this Colab notebook.
